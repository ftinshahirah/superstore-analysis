# 🛒 Superstore Data Analysis

This project explores retail analytics using the Superstore dataset to uncover insights into sales performance, shipping efficiency, and customer behavior across different states and segments.

## 📌 Objectives

1. Identify which product categories and sub-categories drive the most revenue.
2. Evaluate shipping performance and detect patterns of late deliveries.
3. Explore delivery issues on a state level and analyze customer segmentation.
